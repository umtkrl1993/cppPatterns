First version of observer pattern implementation.It does not contain any comments but they will be added shortly.
The example is that there is a weather station which gets data from an external device and there are observers that displays various fields like temperature.
This is just kind of trial version . Necessary amendments will be completed shortly.
In the final version user interfaces implemented using Qt will be added. 
PS : External device is simulated as a thread which randomly generates numbers to send to WeatherData object.
